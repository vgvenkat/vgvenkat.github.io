Currently doing a youtube clone with react and redux. The idea is to add Graphql and _Relay?_ if it makes sense.

Also came across [Google's Mobile web specialist certification](https://developers.google.com/training/certification/mobile-web-specialist/)

The [requirements](https://developers.google.com/training/certification/mobile-web-specialist/StudyGuide-MobileWebSpecialist.pdf) look interesting, might take it at some point. It is $99 USD for the exam. Might help solidify some knowledge.
