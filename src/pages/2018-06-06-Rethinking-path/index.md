I have for a while had a learning path ready. A path that would give me far more wider understanding and insight into the buzzwords and technologies thrown around in tech serverless, vue, flutter, react native, graphql, apollo, prisma, seo, aws and a lot more.

I am in fact very overwhelmed. Lot of newer fleeting things. After a much needed mind reset and this tweet, I am stepping back from all chaos and going deep into ES6 javsacript, react, redux and re-ordering my priorities.
