# SEO FrontEnd Masters

[Modern SEO.pdf](http://bit.ly/modern-seo)

## Traditional SEO

- Crawlers look for how links are connected in a page. Dont mess it up
- **Unique and targeted** content includes relevant terminology. (Front end masters should include sass functions, AMP etc as keywords for depth, adding online learning will be thrown out by search engines)
- Content Richness - add video, gifs, images but also focus on text. SE will look into how long people might want to stay in page
- Frequent Updates. Page is different when crawled freqwuently
- Link Building (Influential sites link to your site)
- Keyword stuffing (over done- not necessary anymore)
- **Businesses with physical locations**
  1. pay for local chamber of commerce
  2. back links from vendors and partners
  3. checkout google search console to see how website ranks for keywords
- **Page Rank**
  1. Inbound links to our site from high quality/ high seo sites increase our page rank
  2. High SEO sites ( more people visit and more inbound links, less outbound links)
- **Long Tail Keywords -** Look for high intent keywords, top keywords are already occupied
