I am planning on doing a 100 day code challenge. It might not be an actual hands-on coding, but alteast learn/read something and write/commit to git everyday.

I came across this article on a perfect file structure to creating a simple giphy search component including styled-components. 

> Should read into it a bit more and create sample project.
